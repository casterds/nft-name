To use The Graph for your proof of concept indexer, you will need to follow these steps:

Create a subgraph: Create a new subgraph using The Graph's command-line tool, graph-cli. Define the data schema for your subgraph, and specify the Ethereum contracts and events that you want to index.

Deploy the subgraph: Deploy your subgraph to The Graph's hosted service, which will automatically index the specified contracts and events.

Query the subgraph: Use The Graph's query language, called GraphQL, to query your subgraph and retrieve specific data. You can use GraphQL client libraries like Apollo Client or Relay to make queries from your front-end.

Build the front-end: Build a simple front-end that allows users to select a collection address and token ID and see the NFT's lifetime events. Use a front-end framework like React or Vue.js, and integrate with your subgraph using a GraphQL client library.
